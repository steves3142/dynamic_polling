## Project Description

### With the pademic in 2020 everything has became remote. This project was designed to give teachers or conference host the ability to poll and get response in real time from from everyone. We added dynamic data charting as responses come in along with a notification system for the host to announce to everyone within the room. All questions asked will be logged and be available to review.
